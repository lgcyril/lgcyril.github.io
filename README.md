# <a href="https://lgcyril.github.io/" target="_blank">Picolas at Adacademy</a> : First group project at <a href="https://adatechschool.fr/" target="_blank">Ada Tech School!</a> In eight days only with fours developers.
**Picolas Team :** Anne, Cyril, Helene and Myriam.<br>
**Link : https://www.lexaloffle.com/bbs/?tid=46811**<br>

**The idea :** In eight days, our Picolas Team has to learn a new programming language called Lua and co-developed a web game for the first time on PICO-8, a fantasy console for making, sharing and playing tiny games and other computer programs. The aim is to learn to do a RPG game about the Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) with dialog boxes.<br>

**The Game :**
Your mission is to discover the neighbourhood around the new school's address(in Paris) and get out of your comfort zone to discover the final surprise.

**Controls      :**
Arrow keys - Move Picolas
[X] - Run and Close dialogue

**Languages     :** Lua (for Pico 8 console), html<br>
**Tools         :** Notion, Slack, Git/GitHub, Visual Studio Code<br>
**Sources       :** https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php , tutorials on YT<br>
**Organization  :** Daily review of the steps to achieve, debugging, mob programming, clean code and agility<br><br>
